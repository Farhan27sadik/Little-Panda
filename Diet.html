        <h1>Dietary Habits of Pandas</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Primary Diet</h2>
        <p>Pandas primarily eat bamboo, which makes up around 99% of their diet. They consume various parts of bamboo, including stems, leaves, and shoots, depending on the season and availability.</p>
        <p>Although bamboo is their staple, pandas occasionally eat other plants, small animals, or carrion if bamboo is scarce, though this is rare in the wild.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Feeding Frequency and Amount</h2>
        <p>Pandas eat a significant amount of food each day, consuming approximately 26 to 84 pounds (12-38 kg) of bamboo to meet their energy needs.</p>
        <p>They spend about 10-16 hours daily eating due to bambooâ€™s low nutrient density, which requires a high volume to sustain their energy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Nutritional Adaptations</h2>
        <p>Pandas have a carnivorous digestive system, yet they have adapted to a herbivorous diet. To compensate, they consume large amounts of bamboo to extract enough nutrients.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Seasonal Diet Variations</h2>
        <p>In the spring and summer, pandas consume bamboo shoots, which are higher in protein.</p>
        <p>During fall and winter, they switch to eating more bamboo leaves and stems, which are readily available but lower in nutrients.</p>
