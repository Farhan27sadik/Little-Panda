        <!-- How Pandas Get Food -->
        <section id="food">
            <h2>How Pandas Get Food</h2>
            <p>Pandas are primarily herbivores, and their diet mainly consists of bamboo, which makes up 99% of their food intake. However, they also eat small amounts of other grasses, fruits, and occasionally small animals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bamboo Feeding:</strong> Pandas spend 10-16 hours a day eating bamboo to meet their energy needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Food Variety:</strong> In addition to bamboo, they may consume other vegetation, fruits, and even scavenged meat in rare cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal Changes:</strong> Pandas adapt their diet based on the seasonal availability of bamboo species.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- How Pandas Protect Themselves -->
        <section id="protection">
            <h2>How Pandas Protect Themselves</h2>
            <p>Pandas may seem docile, but they have developed several ways to protect themselves from predators, such as snow leopards or jackals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Strength:</strong> Pandas are strong animals with powerful jaws and teeth that can bite with great force.</li>
                <li><strong>Climbing Ability:</strong> They can climb trees to escape danger and avoid predators.</li>
                <li><strong>Camouflage:</strong> The pandaâ€™s black-and-white fur helps it blend into the snowy and rocky environment of its habitat.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Sleeping Habits -->
        <section id="sleep">
            <h2>Sleeping Habits</h2>
            <p>Pandas are known for their relaxed lifestyle. They spend a large portion of the day sleeping and resting.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sleep Duration:</strong> Pandas sleep for around 2-4 hours at a time, multiple times throughout the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleeping Locations:</strong> They usually sleep on the forest floor, in hollow trees, or in natural rock caves.</li>
                <li><strong>Diurnal and Nocturnal Patterns:</strong> Pandas do not follow strict day or night patterns and are active at various times of the day.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Interesting Facts -->
        <section id="facts">
            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solitary Lifestyle:</strong> Pandas are generally solitary animals, preferring to live alone, except during mating season.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow Breeders:</strong> Female pandas are only fertile for 2-3 days a year, which makes panda reproduction a challenging process.</li>
                <li><strong>Unique Thumb:</strong> Pandas have a modified wrist bone that functions like a thumb, allowing them to grasp bamboo stems.</li>
